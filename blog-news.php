          This traditionally smoked salmon is a special experience of taste and tradition. A salmon that is smoked differently than the cold smoked salmon that you know from specialty shops or supermarkets. This salmon is different, tastier and exclusive. The traditional way of smoking and steaming means that the salmon is smoked on the skin at a temperature of 80 degrees, which preserves both the structure and the taste of the salmon. This makes the salmon a tasty healthy treat and a high-quality delicacy for anyone who likes atmosphere and conviviality; the Bougondian way of life.
